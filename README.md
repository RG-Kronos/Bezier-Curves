# Bezier-Curves

This is a GUI program to introduce the mathematical concept of BÃ¨zier Curves.

Run the code in VS code or Eclipse. The problem of running the code through cmd or terminal is being resolved.

It includes a descriptive/informative section as well as a simulation section where you can experiment/play with the concept. It is a well constructed program to depict the generation of curves using lines and moving points. It also involves the extensive usage of Swing Java components.

Enjoy !!!
