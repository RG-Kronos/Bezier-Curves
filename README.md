# Bezier-Curves

This is a GUI program to introduce the mathematical concept of BÃ¨zier Curves.

(Run the code file Window.java in VS code or Eclipse, after importing the project in your local folder. The problem of running the code through cmd or terminal is being resolved.)

It includes a descriptive/informative section as well as a simulation section where you can experiment/play with the concept. It is a well constructed program to depict the generation of curves using lines and moving points. It also involves the extensive usage of Swing Java components.

Enjoy !!!
