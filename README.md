# Bezier-Curves

This is a GUI program to introduce the mathematical concept of BÃ¨zier Curves.

To launch the GUI, run the "Window.java" file.

It includes a descriptive/informative section as well as a simulation section where you can experiment/play with the concept. It is a well constructed program to depict the generation of curves using lines and moving points. It also involves the extensive usage of Swing Java components.

Enjoy !!!
