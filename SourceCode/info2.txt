The generation of Bèzier curve works as follows:

Let there be N points originally (2 Anchor pints, N-2 control points).
Assume that the position of all these points is fixed.

There are N-1 lines for each 2 consecutive points.
On the line whose end points are P1 and P2, one point is chosen based on a parameter t.
This is repeated for all N-1 lines using the same parameter value t and thus we obtain N-1 points.

Without changing the parameter value t, we repeat the above iteration for the newly obtained N-1 points until we end up with one single point.
This point is the point of the Bèzier curvature for the chosen parameter value t.
We plot all such points for all parameter values of t.

The final set of points obtained is the final Bèzier curve.
