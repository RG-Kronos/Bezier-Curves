Consider 2 consecutive points P1(x1,y1) and P2(x2,y2).

Imagine a point on the line between P1 and P2 with some fractional distance t. 
Hence, P=P1+(P2-P1)*t (for all t between 0 and 1 (inclusive))
P(x)=P1(x)+(P2(x)-P1(x))*t , P(y)=P1(y)+(P2(y)-P1(y))*t

Considering one particular value of t, repeat the above process for all consecutive point pairs.
Join all the points for that value of t.

Repeat the process for all fractional distances t from 0 to 1.

The final obtained set of points is the final BÃ¨zier curve.
