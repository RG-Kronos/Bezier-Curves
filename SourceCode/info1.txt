A Bezier curve is a mathematically defined curve used in two-dimensional graphic applications. 

The curve is defined by set of points: 
• initial position and the terminating position (called "anchors") 
• middle points (called "handles").

The shape of a Bezier curve can be altered by moving the handles. The mathematical method for drawing curves was created by Pierre Bézier in the late 1960's for the manufacturing of automobiles at Renault.

It is commonly implemented in computer graphics which uses quadratic, cubic Bézier curves. Graphics software programs often come with tools that generate and manipulate Bézier curves, typically with control handles that can control the shape, size and orientation of the curves.
