Changes in the course of art history have been catalyzed by cultural revolutions and complete shifts in human thought; rarely are they attribute to a mathematical equation.

But arguably, a 4 variable algorithm has sculpted the modern-day aesthetics of illustrative design. From cereal boxes to the gallery space, it facilitates an aesthetic of simple shapes, highly-decisive color palettes, and a focus on visual functionality. Its efficiency and optimized format has warranted its position in the toolbox of every digital artist today. And though it may be a trick to pronounce, it contributes to most of the visual works we interact with every day, even the letters you are reading right now would not be as clean and smooth without it.

Rarely can a mathematical equation be attributed to catalyzing a new moment in art language. But rarely are the solutions created as simple and elegant as the Bezier curve.

“I’d already been exposed to the mathematics of Bézier, but not to the wonderful geometric constructions that are associated with it, and the very, very simple computer implementations associated with Béziers. And so once I learned about that it because very natural, very easy to program, very easy to deal with in the computer. I thought all other approaches were silly, after that!” — Adobe co-founder John Warnock in 2004 Interview
